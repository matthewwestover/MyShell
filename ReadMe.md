## MyShell
This was a simple mock command Shell project created in my Masters of Software Development program. It was created for CS6013 - Operating Systems. It was built to immulate some basic functionality as seen in UNIX terminals.

### Supported Commands
Typical built-ins (```ls, touch, mkdir, echo, cat, head, tail```)  
``cd``  
Pipes ```|```   
I/O Direction ```<``` ```>```    
Background ```&```
Shell termination with keywords: ```quit```, ```Quit```, ```exit```, or ```Exit```  

### To Run
1) Download the three C++ files (main.cpp, shelpers.cpp, shelpers.hpp) along with the CMakeLists.txt file  
2) In a terminal navigate to that folder and run ```cmake .```  
3) Run ```make```  
4) Run ./myShell
